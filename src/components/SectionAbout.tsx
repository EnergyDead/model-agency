                    We are building a universal ecosystem for models that operates 24/7, free from the limitations of
                    traditional agencies. At the core is automation of traffic flows: intelligent algorithms channel
                    inbound and outbound opportunities, mapping smart routes between brands, models, and influencers.

                    Conventional agencies rely on manual processes and closed networks. Neo Models shifts the paradigm
                    through technology and transparency: every opportunity is captured in the system, every interaction
                    is scalable. Networking becomes a continuous process where time zones and geography no longer
                    matter.

                <p className="about__text">
                    Automation + community = a new industry standard.
                    We remove entry barriers and generate a constant stream of opportunities — from local shoots to
                    global partnerships. For models, this means independence and flexibility. For brands, it means
                    direct access to a living network of talent where every connection is backed by data and outcomes.

                <p className="about__text">
                    Neo Models is not just an agency. It’s a network that works for you while you sleep. It is the
                    digital compass of fashion — everything aligned around one idea: freedom of choice, open access, and
                    limitless points of connection.
